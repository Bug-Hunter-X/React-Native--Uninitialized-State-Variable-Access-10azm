This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens in functional components before the first render.

```javascript
// Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(); // No initial value

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text> {/* Error: count is undefined */} 
    </View>
  );
}
```
